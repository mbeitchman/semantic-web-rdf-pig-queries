I used a cluster of 5 high-cpu medium instances for this problem. Job details are in job details.zip in the 'problem2' folder.\
\
2.1) \
\
4 map-reduce jobs were generated when running the pig script for problem 2.\
\
2.2)\
\
The first job had 1 map task and 8 reduce tasks and took 14min and 40sec.\
\
The second job had 8 map tasks and 8 reduce tasks and took 33 secs\
\
The third job had 8 map tasks and 1 reduce task and took 23 seconds\
\
The fourth job had 8 map tasks and 8 reduce tasks and took 32 seconds\
\
2.3) \
\
All four jobs took 16 min 8 secs in cumulative runtime.\
\
There were 3 seconds between job 1 and job 2. There were 3 seconds between job 2 and job 3.\
There were 4 seconds between job 3 and job 4.\
\
The total runtime including time between jobs finishing and starting was 16 min 8 seconds.\
