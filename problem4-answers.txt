I used a cluster of 20 high-cpu medium instances for this problem. Job details are in job details.zip in the 'problem4' folder.\
\
4.1) \
\
4 map-reduce jobs were generated when running the pig script for problem 4.\

\
The first job had 251 map task and 33 reduce tasks and took 2 hours 17min and 48sec.\
\
The second job had 99 map tasks and 33 reduce tasks and took 1min and  22sec.\
\
The third job had 33 map tasks and 1 reduce task and took 21 seconds.\
\
The fourth job had 33 map tasks and 33 reduce tasks and took 32 seconds.\
\

\
All four jobs took 2 hr 20 min and 3 seconds in cumulative runtime.\
\
6 seconds elapsed between job 1 finishing and job 2 beginning. 5 seconds elapsed between job 2 and job 3.\
6 seconds elapsed between job 3 and job 4.\
